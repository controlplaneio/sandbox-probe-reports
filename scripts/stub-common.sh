# Shared plumbing for scripts/run-probe-via-*-stub.sh — the mechanical boilerplate every agent stub
# repeats. A stub sources this, then supplies only what's agent-specific: the version command, the
# harness TAGS, the provider config, and the CLI invocation. Not executable; source it:
#     source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/stub-common.sh"
#
# Contract: set PROBE, OUT (required) and optionally PORT, RUNNER, SCAN_ARGS, MOCK_HOST, PROBE_CMD.
#   stub_init                 validate inputs; set RUNNER/SCAN_ARGS; mkdir OUT's dir
#   stub_semver <cmd...>      print a whitespace-free version token (or "unknown")
#   stub_start_mock           launch the stubbed model API, arm cleanup, block until it's listening
#   stub_finish <label>       dump the mock request log; assert the probe wrote OUT
# Register scratch to remove with STUB_SCRATCH+=(dir); for anything fancier (e.g. restoring a moved
# file) define a stub_extra_cleanup function — the EXIT trap runs it before removing STUB_SCRATCH.
